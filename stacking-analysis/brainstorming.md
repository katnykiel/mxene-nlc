## Current 

- elastic constants <-> reduced structures <-> melting temperatures
- convex hull data <-> relaxed structures 
- relaxed structures <-> initial structures
- initial structurse <-> stacking sequence

## Required

- stacking sequence : melting temperature : convex hull

## Route

- map from relaxed to reduced structures
- get exact stacking sequence of relaxed structures
